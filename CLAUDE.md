# CLAUDE.md

This repository is a **Claude plugin** that packages product management skills.

## Goals

- Keep everything **public-safe** (no secrets, tokens, private playbooks).
- Keep skills useful for **professional PMs** (Fortune 500 → growth-stage), not indie-hacker-only advice.
- Prefer **clear, structured outputs** over generic brainstorming.

## Repo structure

- `.claude-plugin/` — plugin metadata
- `skills/` — skill folders containing `SKILL.md`

## Style guidelines for skills

- Use simple language.
- Bias toward templates that produce **defensible artifacts**:
  - decision memos
  - PRDs
  - tradeoffs / risks
  - success metrics
  - edge cases / acceptance criteria
- Don’t claim fabricated numbers or fake customer proof.

## Safety

Do not add:
- internal IDs
- auth cookies
- API keys
- private operational workflows
